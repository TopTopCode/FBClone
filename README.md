# FBClone
This project is a clone of FB News Feed. Converted to Swift3 syntax (Courtesy: https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/)
It covers topics like:
1) Using a UICollectionView to make a vertical scrolling component
2) Dynamic Cell content and Loading Images
3) Load images asynchronously and caching using NSCache
4) Adding a custom UITabBar to suit to that of FB
5) Animation that zooms the image into the center of the screen

All of the above with no StoryBoards used. Clean, re-usable code following MVC pattern.
